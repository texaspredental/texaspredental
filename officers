            <h4>Major</h4>
            <p>Finance, Real Estate Management</p>

            <h4>Hometown</h4>
            <p>Plano, Texas</p>

            <h4>What are your other interests or involvements?</h4>
            <p>I used to be on the rowing team for UT and am actively involved with Texas Business Healthcare Association, an organization that bridges the gap between business and healthcare! Aside from regularly volunteering and shadowing dentists, I work as a software engineer and web developer!</p>

            <h4>What do you like the most about TPS?</h4>
            <p>My favorite aspect of TPS is the number of opportunities each member gets. TPS provides so many unique and useful opportunities to its members, whether it may be DAT study sessions or just advice on dental school applications from current dental students!</p>

            <h4>How do you relieve stress?</h4>
            <p>I love boxing, working out, and anything outdoors! It helps clear my mind and relieve tension!</p>

            <h4>What is your advice for fellow pre-dental students?</h4>
            <p>Make sure you are passionate about dentistry so that you may use that passion to motivate yourself towards success!</p>

            <h4>What do you like the most about TPS?</h4>
            <p>Families/Big-Little Program. This gives members the opportunity to mentor and share their path to applying for dental school. It also allows members to build a stronger relationship with other members in the organization.</p>

            <h4>How do you relieve stress?</h4>
            <p>I relieve my stress by working out, taking a drive, listening to music, playing sports, and spending time outdoors.</p>

            <h4>What is your advice for fellow pre-dental students?</h4>
            <p>I'd advise pre-dental students to be involved with TPS as much as possible. TPS gives you the opportunity to learn about dentistry & the numerous routes of getting into dental school, offers dental school trips, volunteer opportunities, & a shadowing program, and allows you to make great new friends. Take advantage of everything TPS has to offer!</p>

            <h4>What do you like the most about TPS?</h4>

            <h4>What are your other interests or involvements?</h4>
            <p>I enjoy working out, playing sports, dancing (somewhat), video games, and watching anime. I am also a member of Texas Healthy Habits, Filipino Student Association, and the current Treasurer of Gamma Beta Fraternity, Inc.</p>

            <h4>What do you like the most about TPS?</h4>
            <p>My favorite thing about TPS is that it acts as a supportive community in the midst of a very competitive school. From visiting dental schools to befriending someone that is on almost the EXACT route as me, I have received endless amounts of help in my aspiration of becoming a dentist.</p>

            <h4>How do you relieve stress?</h4>
            <p>Depending on what type of stress I'm experiencing, I either like to go out for a long run or simply interact with other people. Anything that clears my mind, really.</p>

            <h4>What is your advice for fellow pre-dental students?</h4>
            <p>Find a mentor within TPS and/or someone that recently got accepted into dental school! The path of becoming a successful applicant can be very uncertain and ambiguous for those without much guidance. Don't be shy to ever ask questions or for any sort of help, that's what TPS is for!</p>

            <h4>What is your advice for fellow pre-dental students?</h4>
            <p>Find students who are older than you and ask them to be your mentor. Learning from others' experiences is probably the best thing you can do. They know all the resources, they've made mistakes and they've been in your shoes!</p>

            <h4>Hometown</h4>
            <p>Richardson, Texas</p>

            <h4>What are your other interests or involvements?</h4>
            <p>I am interested in sports, movies/theater, entrepreneurship (Shark Tank style), and magic tricks. My hobbies include all things related to sports. I play most of the conventional sports such as basketball and football. However, I am also very intrigued and have picked up several other underrated sports such as bowling, Ping-Pong, and volleyball. I am involved in the Vietnamese Student Association, Filipino Student Association, and Natural Sciences Council.</p>

            <h4>What do you like the most about TPS?</h4>
            <p>If you truly open up to TPS and make a commitment to become involved, you begin to realize the incredible opportunities that this organization provides for you. It really helps you take steps toward your dream career whether that is by providing service opportunities, shadowing opportunities, or DAT/Application advice. I have also met some incredible friends through this organization, and it has made this stressful journey a little more enjoyable thus far.</p>

            <h4>How do you relieve stress?</h4>
            <p>I always use meals as a time to regroup and recharge. I always give myself an hour for lunch or for dinner. During this time, I watch videos on YouTube or watch a show that I love (Shark Tank), and just allow myself to enjoy that meal. Typically, I had already studied for a large amount of time before this meal, and intend on studying for a large amount of time after this meal so I need this break. After an exam, I do as many activities unrelated to academics as possible.</p>

            <h4>What is your advice for fellow pre-dental students?</h4>
            <p>ASK FOR ADVICE!!! Trying to get into dental school is stressful, nerve-wracking, and DIFFICULT! But there are so many individuals that have gone through exactly what you are about to go through, and do not be afraid to talk to them! Ask them for their thoughts and if they have any tips for you (DAT, applications, courses at UT, etc.). It will not only make you feel better, but it will also give you a direction to take your next steps towards this wonderful career. You do not have to go through this all alone.</p>

            <h4>What do you like the most about TPS?</h4>
            <p>My favorite thing about TPS is how determined, encouraging, and willing everyone is to help each other. It is such a blessing to be able to surround myself with such a motivating atmosphere and TPS taught me that being a dentist is not only about fixing teeth but also about keeping a positive attitude and truly caring about the community.</p>

            <h4>How do you relieve stress?</h4>
            <p>By being outdoors. Golfing, running, hiking, and just being out in nature!</p>

            <h4>What is your advice for fellow pre-dental students?</h4>
            <p>Occasionally we get so overwhelmed with all of the things we have to do in order to get to the future and reach our goals. But I believe that it's very important to slow down, take time out to reflect, and enjoy this wonderful journey by taking one step at a time.</p>
