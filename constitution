          </p>
          <p>
            The Executive Board shall be elected by the paid members of the club at the end of the fall semester and shall serve for the two following semesters. Each
            officer is also responsible for aiding the newly elected officers, after their terms of service, as necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong><em>ARTICLE III: ELECTION PROCEDURES AND ELIGIBILITY</em></strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>SECTION I: GENERAL ELECTION PROCEDURES</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Elections for offices comprising the Executive Board will be held at the final meeting of the fall semester. Elected positions include: President, Vice
            President, Secretary, Treasurer, Community Service Representative, Public Relations Representative, Social Representative, FLOSS Chair, and Webmaster.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to run for office, a candidate must fill out an application and interview with a panel of current officers prior to elections. This panel will
            include the officer holding the position that the candidate is running for. This panel will exclude all officers that are running for the position that the
            candidate is running for, in order to avoid biased interviews. This exclusion clause shall override the inclusion clause, in the event of a conflict. The
            applications will be due on a date that is assigned by the President, at least two weeks prior to the elections. At this time, the President will set up
            necessary meetings with all the candidates.
          </p>
          <p>
            After interviewing all the candidates, all officers (excluding officers running for the position being discussed) shall discuss and vote, by two-thirds
            majority, on which candidates will be placed on the election ballot. This shall be done by the officers with the utmost ethical and moral standards. This
            process must all take place at least one week before the elections are to take place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Officers shall hold no more than one elected position during their term of office.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>SECTION II: RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY</em>
          </p>

            as outlined in BYLAWS, ARTICLE III, SECTION I.
          </p>

            run for presidency.
          </p>
          <p>
            If approved by the Executive Board in the procedure stated above, said officer shall make an appeal to the paid members at a special general meeting hosted
            at least two weeks before the fall elections. The paid members at that meeting shall then take a two-thirds majority vote to decide if said officer is
            elected as President. If the two-thirds majority vote is not passed, then the position of President shall open up to Distinguished FLOSS members, Honorable FLOSS members, Active FLOSS members, Distinguished general members, Honorable general members, active members, and all paid members, in that order.
          </p>
          <p>

            semester. When signing in to the meeting, each paid member will receive one ballot for each position, from officers that are not participating in the
            election.

            officers not running for the position being voted on.

            Representative, FLOSS Chair, Webmaster-in that order, will succeed the President for the remainder of the term. For any other Executive Board vacancies,
